		<p>The <a href="http://www.macraigor.com/wiggler.htm">Macraigor Wiggler</a> is a JTAG interface which connects to a PC through the parallel port. If you want to buy one, a much cheaper clone is available from <a href="https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-JTAG/">Olimex</a>. Instead, if you fancy making your own circuit board and have the necessary components to hand, you can make your own. Cheaper than a kit for learning and useful for your other projects too.</p>

		<p>Whilst going through something of a PCB building phase, I did a board layout for the interface after entering the schematic for the standard design into Eagle CAD. Grab the Eagle files for the schematic and layout <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/wlecqizq38pn7cc/JTAG_Wiggler_v2.1_EL.zip">here</a>. The layout was intended for single sided home made PCB construction using etching, hence the wide traces.</p>

		<p>Once you've built your wiggler, have a look at the page for <a href="https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-JTAG/">Olimex</a> adapter for lots of good links on what free tools are available to get the best use out of the interface. I tend to use the on-chip debugger created by Dominic Rath called <a href="http://openocd.sourceforge.net/">OpenOCD</a>, see the <a href="http://openocd.sourceforge.net/doc/html/index.html">user guide</a> for comprehensive instructions on getting started with it.</p>
