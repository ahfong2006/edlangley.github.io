		<p>Well, so far all this page has got to show for itself is a Qt port of the procedural brick shader demo from chapter 6 of the OpenGLÂ® Shading Language, Second Edition book by Randi J. Rost. As Randi suggests in that chapter, I've added the Z dimension:</p>

		<table id="captionedpicture">
			<tr><td><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/projects/glsl-demos/brick-qt.png" alt="Screenshot of a procedurally shaded cube covered with an orange bricks and grey mortar pattern"/></td></tr>
		</table>

<!--more-->

		<p>If you want to take a closer look, you can find the code on Github <a href="https://github.com/edlangley/brick-qt">here</a>.

		<p>More to come on this page when I get around to it.</p>
