description: "How to use JTAG on i.MX6 in order to rescue a bricked i.MX6 chip when the on-chip bootloader won't boot. Using OpenOCD on i.MX6 to load code through GDB."
---

Freescale's i.MX6 chips have rather comprehensive secure booting capabilities. When enabled, the High Assurance Boot (HAB) framework in the chip allows only signed binaries to be loaded by the on-chip boot ROM. The code signing is based on assymetric cryptographic keys, the public keys are burnt into OTP registers on the chip. Here I describe how I got the process of enabling i.MX6 secure boot wrong, then after despairing that the customer's shiny new Â£400 [SabreSD](http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=RDIMX6SABREBRD) board was now unbootable, managed to recover it with JTAG.

<!--more-->

First of all, there are plenty of guides on how to enable secure boot using HABv4 on i.MX6, so rather than re-hashing that information here, have a look at:

* [Application Note 4581: Secure Boot on i.MX50, i.MX53, and i.MX 6 Series using HABv4](http://cache.freescale.com/files/32bit/doc/app_note/AN4581.pdf) from Freescale
* the i.MX 6 Linux High Assurance Boot (HAB) User's Guide (Document number IMX6HABUG) from the Freescale i.MX6 Sabre Linux BSP release L3.0.35_4.1.0 (see [here](http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=IMX6_SW), login required)
* the [iMX6 SECURE BOOT on Nitrogen 6X SOM module](https://community.freescale.com/servlet/JiveServlet/download/325535-259256/secure_boot_on_imx6.pdf) guide from the RISE Lab at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.

Having read those, there are some important points to pick up on. Each of those guides gives essentially the same steps, but with slightly different instructions. For those readers who are just skimming and didn't read the above documents, roughly the steps are:

1. Prepare U-boot and Linux with extra boot image layout (Image Vector Table) and calls in U-boot to the HAB functions in the on chip ROM. (The Freescale L3.0.35_4.1.0 i.MX6 Linux BSP has all these patches built-in, this project was based around the offerings in the Yocto Dora Freescale Community BSP, which complicated things somewhat)
2. Get the Freescale HAB Code Signing Tools (CST) and secure boot scripts, a collection of Bash scripts and a few x86 Linux binaries.
 Run a script in the CST bundle to build a set of RSA public/private key pairs, referred to as the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) tree. Each key pair is referred to as a Super Root Key (SRK) 
3. Using the secure boot scripts, combined with the CSTs, sign the U-boot and Linux images using the private keys (Which should indeed be kept private, to ensure that only authorised parties can create signed images)
4. Using either the i.MX specific otp commands in U-boot, or some i.MX sysfs nodes under Linux, write a hash of each of the SRKs to the One Time Programmable (OTP) fuses in the i.MX6 chip.
5. Check that the HAB enabled U-boot does not report any HAB events after being loaded by the on-chip bootloader, or after authenticating the Linux image
6. Once all is well, set the chip into secure mode by setting a bit in another OTP fuse. At that point, only correctly signed images can be loaded.

## It all looks good, 'til it's not

You can tell the CSTs to generate between one and four key pairs. The SRK hash for each public key is a pair of 32 bit values (For the 32 bit eFuse registers). The guides all say create four key pairs, then program all 8 SRK hash values into the fuses. Trouble is, I decided that rather than blindly follow the instructions and load all 8 SRK hashes in, I would just load one in. That way, if it went wrong somehow, I'd still have 3 more chances to get it right.

So having signed my images, and written the hash for a single key pair to the OTP fuses, I duly ran U-boot and checked for HAB events when it was loaded, and then when the Linux image is loaded:

</pre></div>

The lines reading "No HAB Events Found!" give the all clear that firstly, the signed U-boot image was successully authenticated by the HAB calls in the on-chip bootloader, then secondly that the Linux image was authenticated by U-boot making calls back into the HAB code in on-chip ROM.

So the moment of truth comes, and I set the OTP fuse bit for "Closed configuration" which tells the i.MX6 on-chip bootloader to only run correctly signed images. I take a deep breath, hit the reset button on the board and, nothing. Nada. No boot messages. Uh-oh. Hit reset again, still nothing. Oh dear. "How much does this board cost again?".

After while, a section was found in one of the guides mentioned above [AN4581: Secure Boot on i.MX50, i.MX53, and i.MX 6 Series using HABv4](http://cache.freescale.com/files/32bit/doc/app_note/AN4581.pdf), in Rev 0, section 7.1: "Troubleshooting: SRK Authentication for i.MX 6 Series in Open Configuration" which reads:

> "There is a known limitation about the verification of the SRK table in the ROM of i.MX 6 Series devices.
In these devices, the intent was to only verify the SRK table hash, when the SRK fuse field was non-zero
for Open configuration. However, for i.MX 6 Series in Open configuration, the HAB always skips the
verification of the SRK table, regardless of whether the SRK fuse field has been provisioned or not.
This means that it is necessary to ensure that the SRK field is correctly programmed, prior to moving the
i.MX 6 Series security configuration to Closed. It is highly recommended to use the srktool included as
part of the CST release. The byte ordering of the SRK table hash value should be correct to ensure proper
operation."

What I took this to mean is that, if the CST script is told to create 4 key pairs (It was) but then not all 8 SRK hashes are burnt into the fuses, then this should throw HAB errors in open configuration mode when verifying the SRK hash table, but it doesn't do the verification in open mode, due to the "known limitation". Then when the chip is put into closed configuration, verification of the SRK hashes fails, and there is no boot.

## Talking to the chip

After pondering the situation for a few minutes, I thought: "Well, if I can get control of the chip using JTAG, I could poke enough registers to get the OTP controller running and program the rest of the SRK hash fuses". After rummaging around the office I found a [Flyswatter](http://www.tincantools.com/JTAG/Flyswatter.html) made by TinCanTools. Without a suitable JTAG adapter cable a quick bit of improvisation got it hooked up to the SABRESD board:

<table id="captionedpicture">
	<tr><td>
		<img src="{{ site.url }}/img/blog/rescuing-bricked-secure-mode-i.mx6/flyswatter-sabresd-wiring.jpg" alt="Some rather messy improvised wiring between the Flyswatter and the SABRESD board. The wires are pushed into the crimps on the exposed backs of ribbon cable plugs" />
	</td></tr>
</table>

Next I downloaded the latest release of [OpenOCD](http://openocd.sourceforge.net/), at the time that was version 0.7.0. Extract, and build:

<div class="preformatted_console"><pre>
$ ./configure --enable-ft2232_libftdi
$ make
</pre></div>


I tweaked the config file tcl/interface/flyswatter.cfg, as the enumerated USB device name didn't match on my PC:

	interface ft2232
	#ft2232_device_desc "Flyswatter"
	ft2232_layout "flyswatter"
	ft2232_vid_pid 0x0403 0x6010


Given the poor wiring, I found I had to lower the clock rate for the JTAG signalling down to 100 KHz in tcl/target/imx6.cfg:

	#jtag_rclk 1000
	#$_TARGETNAME configure -event reset-start { jtag_rclk 1000 }
	adapter_khz 100
	$_TARGETNAME configure -event reset-start { adapter_khz 100 }

I just ran OpenOCD without installing:

<div class="preformatted_console"><pre>
$ sudo src/openocd -f tcl/interface/flyswatter.cfg -f tcl/target/imx6.cfg
</pre></div>

After changing a wire and running it a few times, it eventually worked:

A few commands to try at the prompt for starters included:

	cortex_a dbginit
	halt
	reset
	reg
	resume
	halt
	reg


Soon I established that some registers in the on-chip register set are unaccessible after reset, including:

RAM, not initialised:

<div class="preformatted_console"><pre>
> mdw phys 0x10000000 1
</pre></div>

SRC_BASE_ADDR:

<div class="preformatted_console"><pre>
> mdw 0x20d8000 1
</pre></div>

Accessing those causes:

<div class="preformatted_console"><pre>
JTAG-DP STICKY ERROR
MEM_AP_CSW 0x28000d2, MEM_AP_TAR 0x10000000

MEM_AP_CSW 0x28000d2, MEM_AP_TAR 0x10000000
Block read error address 0x0
in procedure 'mdw'
</pre></div>

The only way out of getting that message on all further memory accesses is to then reset the board with the reset button, then halt again.

After some research I eventually found that the way to access AHB-AP registers via JTAG on the i.MX6 is with the following OpenOCD command:

<div class="preformatted_console"><pre>
> dap apcsw 1
</pre></div>


## Snatching a boot from the jaws of brickery

Having established that I could still talk to the four CPUs on the i.MX6 over JTAG, the plan then was to script enough register accesses to effect the remaining SRK efuse burns through the OTP controller. After a quick rethink, I decided it may be quicker to initialise the DRAM, then load and run some code instead.

Shortly afterward I found an example OpenOCD config for the SABRESD to setup the DRAM on the Freescale forums. You can grab my version of [sabresd.cfg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/nvwk9llor9ewxbn/sabresd.cfg) with a few small tweaks.

I Ran OpenOCD with this extra board config file, after placing it in the tcl/board subdirectory:

<div class="preformatted_console"><pre>
$ sudo src/openocd -f tcl/interface/flyswatter.cfg -f tcl/target/imx6.cfg -f tcl/board/sabresd.cfg

</pre></div>

Then at the OpenOCD command prompt, run the function from sabresd.cfg which will setup the DRAM and test a read access:

<div class="preformatted_console"><pre>
> ddr_init
> mdw phys 0x10000000 1
0x10000000: 5ed7deee
</pre></div>

Et voila!

Now at this point, by default OpenOCD is also running a GDB server on localhost port 3333, which a suitable GDB targetting the appropriate architecture can use to control the target. This allows an ELF file to be loaded, such as say, u-boot:

</pre></div>

Now switch back to the serial port terminal and Lo! there is a U-boot prompt waiting for us. At that point I carefully burnt in the rest of the SRK fuses, and after a push of the reset button, the signed binaries were running.

## Conclusions

When all seemed lost above, and the first halt command was issued at the OpenOCD prompt, the program counter was at 0x00000fb6. This address is within the mask ROM on-chip bootloader. Successive resumes and halts show the pc register spinning around close to this address. This takes some of the mystery out of the secure boot framework on i.MX6. The bootloader is simply checking the values in the SRK fuses with some (albeit complex) cryptographic operations, and if they don't work out, and the closed config fuse bit is set, simply spins forever, halting the boot. The chip remains otherwise entirely functional, and can easily be overtaken by means other than the bootloader in order to get it running code, as we have done.

## Caveats

If you want to try a bit of JTAG debugging on i.MX6 with OpenOCD yourself, here are a couple of things I observed when using it with this particular SoC:

* When power cycling or resetting the board with the button, you need to quit and re-run OpenOCD.
* When resetting with any method, you need to redo the target remote command in GDB.

Otherwise, OpenOCD will look like its working, but gather incorrect CPU register values, which can get very misleading.

Have fun!
